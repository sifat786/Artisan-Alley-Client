It's characterized by its versatility, allowing artists to blend colors, create rich textures, and achieve various effects through layering and manipulation of the paint. Oil paintings often boast depth, richness, and a luminous quality due to the slow drying time of the oil, which enables artists to work gradually and make changes over an extended period. This medium has been widely used for centuries, producing some of the most iconic and enduring works of art in history."

The soft texture of charcoal allows for smooth blending and shading, while also allowing for expressive marks and textures. Overall, charcoal sketching offers artists a dynamic way to capture the essence of their subjects with bold strokes and subtle nuances."
